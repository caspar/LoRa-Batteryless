The power supply runs @ 5V for t milliseconds.

The voltage regulator is set to 3.3 +/- 0.01V.

Data is saved in the order: second, V_supply, V_in, I_other, I_in

Where...

V_supply is the voltage from the power supply.
V_in is the voltage at the 3V3 pin of the LoRaWAN module.
I_other is the voltage representing current from all connections to GND except that of the LoRaWAN module.
I_in is the voltage representing current from the GND pin of the LoRaWAN module to GND.

Resistance between LoRaWAN module GND pin and true GND: 1.071 +/- 0.0005 Ohms.

Resistance between other components and GND: 0.212 +/- 0.001 Ohms.
